        Old English Bulldogs, also known as English Bulldogs, are a breed of dog that has captured the hearts of many dog lovers around the world. With their unique appearance and charming personalities, these dogs have become popular pets and symbols of strength and resilience.

        Historically, Old English Bulldogs were bred for bull-baiting, a sport that involved dogs attacking and pinning down bulls. This intense and dangerous activity required a dog with strength, agility, and determination. However, with the outlawing of bull-baiting in the 19th century, the breed faced an uncertain future. Thankfully, a small group of dedicated breeders worked tirelessly to preserve and transform the Old English Bulldog into the lovable companion we know today.

        One of the most distinctive features of Old English Bulldogs is their physical appearance. They have a stout and muscular build, with a broad head and a distinctive wrinkled face. Their low-slung bodies, short legs, and compact size give them a unique and adorable look. Additionally, their loose skin and expressive eyes make them incredibly endearing.

        Despite their muscular appearance, Old English Bulldogs are known for their gentle and affectionate nature. They are incredibly loyal and form strong bonds with their owners and families. They are often referred to as "sourmugs" due to their perpetual frowning expression, but don't let their serious face fool you – they have a playful and goofy side that can instantly brighten up your day.

        These dogs are also known for their calm and laid-back demeanor. They are generally not as energetic as some other breeds, making them suitable for apartment living. However, they still require regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight and prevent obesity. A leisurely walk or a game of fetch in the backyard is usually sufficient to keep them happy and healthy.

        One important aspect of owning an Old English Bulldog is their health. Due to their unique physical structure, they are prone to certain health issues, including respiratory problems, joint and hip dysplasia, and skin infections. Responsible breeders prioritize the health and well-being of their dogs and undertake rigorous health testing to minimize these issues. Prospective owners should be prepared for potential medical expenses and provide these dogs with proper care and attention.

        In recent years, the popularity of Old English Bulldogs has soared, thanks in part to their appearance in pop culture and media. They have become iconic symbols of strength and determination, often representing tenacity and resilience. Their charming personalities and unique looks have made them beloved pets for families, celebrities, and dog enthusiasts alike.

        In conclusion, Old English Bulldogs are a breed that combines strength, charm, and affection in a compact package. Despite their historical background, they have evolved into loyal and loving companions. Whether you are looking for a couch buddy or an occasional walking partner, these dogs are sure to bring joy and laughter into your life.

        <strong>
            1. You should budget anywhere from $3,700 upwards to $8,500 or even more for an Olde English Bulldogge with top breed lines and a superior pedigree<br>
            2. The Olde English Bulldogge is a crossbreed of the English Bulldog, the American Bulldog, the American Pitbull Terrier, and the Bull Mastiff, while the English Bulldog is a purebred dog.<br>
            3. Olde English Bulldogges are sturdy, muscular and big-boned — yet, somewhat nimble and athletic. Their powerful, bulky heads have broad muzzles and furrowed brows. <br>
            4.  Like other bulldog breeds, the Olde English Bulldogge is a stocky and muscular dog;  however, they do not get exceptionally big. Males should weigh between 60 to 80 pounds, and 17″-20″ at the withers<br>
            5. OEB’s are a very friendly breed who are “people pleasers,” loyal, lively, docile and devoted to their families.<br>
            6. While the Olde English Bulldogge is a very friendly dog, they can be territorial when it comes to other dogs. This is especially true for larger dogs of the same sex.<br>
            7. Originally bred in the 1970s by David Leavitt, the Olde English Bulldogge was meant to be a throwback to the 18th century Bulldog<br>
            8. In order to distinguish his line from others, Leavitt called his dogs the “Leavitt Bulldogs.” Though they were often misspelled as “bulldogges.” However, when the UKC finally recognized these dogs in 2014, they officially named them Olde English Bulldogges.<br>
            9. As Leavitt intended, Bulldogges will be very energetic and enthusiastic dogs.<br>
            10. With a dominant personality, the last thing you’d want is a destructive Bulldogge.<br>
